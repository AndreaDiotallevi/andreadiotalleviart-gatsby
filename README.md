## Technologies Used

- Main technologies:
  * [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/): Used to build static sites that are Progressive Web Apps, follow the latest web standards, and are optimized to be highly performant. It makes use of the latest and popular technologies including ReactJS, Webpack, GraphQL, modern ES6+ JavaScript and CSS.
